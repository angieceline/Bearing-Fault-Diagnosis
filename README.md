# Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis
Machine learning methods using time-domain features were tested for bearing fault detection with CWRU and Paderborn data. SVM gave the best accuracy, while 1D-CNNs on raw signals also performed strongly. Combining classical ML and deep learning improved overall fault diagnosis.
